# Canvave

[Canvave](https://canvave.com/) is a design platform for creating image or animation.

I used to make posters, banners, and animations by some design tools, but most of them were too confusing for me, the heavy functions and materials dazzled me. I really need a simple and clear interface and operation. So Canvave was born. You can create images/animations of any size (up to 3x resolution and 240FPS <del>in the near future</del>) on a simple panel.

- 🪄 Easy for creating animations in seconds
- 🎨 Good for any size
- 📦 Customize shapes/fonts/images
- ⚡️ Export image as PNG/JPG or animation as MP4/GIF for free 
- 🚀 AI features ready to go
